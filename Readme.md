This project contains the following:

The whitepaper describing the NanoSat algorithm, called PvsNP.pdf
NanoSat source as NanoSat.zip
Different sizes formulae (around 47000) as .zip folders
Two of the most well known and used 3-SAT engines in the Othe 3-SAT Engines.zip file

Note: 
all the size 100 files used as benchmark are split into 5 .zip since the entire suite was way too big even as a .zip
if you want to try them all sequentially, merge all .cnf file into one folder, together with NanoSat.exe
